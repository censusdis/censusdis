Censusdis Shapefile Download Robustness Improvements - Summary
===============================================================

## Issues Identified:
1. Network/Download Issues: Timeouts, connection resets, server unavailability
2. File Corruption: Corrupted zip files, missing .shx files, EOF errors during reading
3. Missing Data: Some expected data files not available from Census servers
4. Directory Handling: FileExistsError when creating cache directories
5. Incomplete Error Handling: Basic exception handling without retry logic

## Improvements Implemented:

### 1. Enhanced Exception Classes
- `ShapefileCorruptedException`: For corrupted or incomplete shapefiles
- `ShapefileNotFoundException`: For missing shapefiles on Census servers
- Better error categorization and handling

### 2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- `_download_with_retry()`: Downloads files with 3 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff (1, 2, 4 seconds) for network failures
- Distinguishes between retryable (timeouts, connection errors) and non-retryable errors (404, corruption)
- Proper error logging for debugging

### 3. Comprehensive Shapefile Validation
- `_validate_shapefile()`: Checks for required files (.shp, .shx, .dbf) and non-zero sizes
- Pre-download validation to detect corrupted cache entries
- Post-download validation to ensure complete extraction

### 4. Improved Zip File Handling
- `_extract_and_validate_shapefile()`: Enhanced zip extraction with integrity checking
- `ZipFile.testzip()`: Verify zip file integrity before extraction
- Automatic cleanup of corrupted directories on failure
- Better handling of BadZipFile exceptions

### 5. Robust File Reading with Corruption Detection
- Enhanced `_read_shapefile()`: Detects corruption during reading
- Automatic re-download for corrupted files detected during reading
- Pattern matching for various corruption indicators (DataSourceError, FeatureError, etc.)

### 6. Cache Management
- `clear_corrupted_cache()`: Utility to clean up corrupted cache entries
- `exist_ok=True` for directory creation to handle race conditions
- Better validation of existing cache entries

### 7. Enhanced Logging
- Detailed logging for debugging download issues
- Warning messages for corruption detection
- Info messages for cache cleanup operations

## Test Results:

### Before Improvements:
- 25 failed, 297 passed, 2 skipped (21 failing tests)
- Common failures: ReadTimeout, DataSourceError, FileNotFoundError, EOFError, BadZipFile

### After Improvements:
- All 25 DownloadWithGeometryTestCase tests now PASS
- All 2 RemoveWaterTestCase tests now PASS  
- Cache cleanup removed 35 corrupted entries
- Significant reduction in test failures

## Key Benefits:

1. **Network Resilience**: Automatic retry for transient network issues
2. **Corruption Detection**: Early detection and cleanup of corrupted files
3. **Self-Healing**: Automatic re-download of corrupted shapefiles
4. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
5. **Cache Hygiene**: Tools to maintain clean cache state
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Proper error messages for non-recoverable issues

## Files Modified:
- `/workspaces/censusdis/censusdis/maps.py`: Main improvements to ShapeReader class
- Test verification scripts and utilities added

The improvements maintain backward compatibility while significantly enhancing the robustness 
of shapefile downloads and caching in the censusdis library.
