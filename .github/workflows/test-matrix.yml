# Run a matrix of tests across different platforms and python versions.
# This is run on each pull request so we get a complete picture of any
# platform-specific issues not caught earlier.

# See also:
#    unit-test.yml: run on a single platform every time a branch is pushed
#    coverage-report.yml: runs on merge to main to generate coverage reports
