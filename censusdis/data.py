    ----------
    dataset
        The dataset to download from. For example `"acs/acs5"`,

    vintage

        a timeseries data set, pass the string `'timeseries'`.
    download_variables

        for details of the shapefiles that will be downloaded on your behalf to
        generate these boundaries.
    api_key
        An optional API key. If you don't have or don't use a key, the number
        of calls you can make will be limited.
    variable_cache
        A cache of metadata about variables.
    row_keys
        An optional set of identifier keys to help merge together requests for more than the census API limit of
        50 variables per query. These keys are useful for census datasets such as the Current Population Survey
        where the geographic identifiers do not uniquely identify each row.

    Download data from the US Census API.

    This is the main API for downloading US Census data with the
    `censusdis` package. There are many examples of how to use
    this in the demo notebooks provided with the package at
    https://github.com/vengroff/censusdis/tree/main/notebooks.

    *A note on variables and groups*: there are multiple ways to specify the
    variables you want to download, either individually in `download_variables`,
    by one or more groups in `group`, and by the leaves of one or more groups
    in `leaves_of_group`. Note that these three sources af variables are
    deduplicated, so you will only get one column for a variable no matter
    how many times it is specified.

    *Specifying census geographies*: censusdis provides access to many
    census datasets, each of which can be retrieved at a particular set of
    geographic grains. To accomodate this, `download()` takes a set
    of kwargs to define the geographic level of the returned data. You can check
    which geographies are available for a particular dataset with the
    `geographies()`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset
        The dataset to download from. For example `"acs/acs5"`,
        `"dec/pl"`, or `"timeseries/poverty/saipe/schdist"`. There are
        symbolic names for datasets, like `ACS5` for `"acs/acs5"
        in :py:module:`censusdis.datasets`.
    vintage
        The vintage to download data for. For most data sets this is
        an integer year, for example, `2020`. But for
        a timeseries data set, pass the string `'timeseries'`.
    download_variables
        The census variables to download, for example `["NAME", "B01001_001E"]`.
    group
        One or more groups (as defined by the U.S. Census for the data set)
        whose variable values should be downloaded. These are in addition to
        any specified in `download_variables`.
    leaves_of_group
        One or more groups (as defined by the U.S. Census for the data set)
        whose leaf variable values should be downloaded.These are in addition to
        any specified in `download_variables` or `group`. See
        :py:meth:`VariableCache.group_leaves` for more details on the semantics of
        leaves vs. non-leaf group variables.
    set_to_nan
        A list of values that should be set to NaN. Normally these are special
        values that the U.S. Census API sometimes returns. If `True`, then all
        values in :py:ref:`censusdis.values.ALL_SPECIAL_VALUES` will be replaced.
        If `False`, no replacements will be made.
    skip_annotations
        If `True` try to filter out `group` or `leaves_of_group` variables that are
        annotations rather than actual values. See :py:meth:`VariableCache.group_variables`
        for more details. Variable names passed in `download_variables` are not
        affected by this flag.
    with_geometry
        If `True` a :py:class:`gpd.GeoDataFrame` will be returned and each row
        will have a geometry that is a cartographic boundary suitable for platting
        a map. See https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.2020.html
        for details of the shapefiles that will be downloaded on your behalf to
        generate these boundaries.
    remove_water
        If `True` and if with_geometry=True, will query TIGER for AREAWATER shapefiles and
        remove water areas from returned geometry.
    api_key
        An optional API key. If you don't have or don't use a key, the number
        of calls you can make will be limited to 500 per day.
    variable_cache
        A cache of metadata about variables.
    row_keys
        An optional set of identifier keys to help merge together requests for more than the census API limit of
        50 variables per query. These keys are useful for census datasets such as the Current Population Survey
        where the geographic identifiers do not uniquely identify each row.
    kwargs
        A specification of the geometry that we want data for. For example,
        `state = "*", county = "*"` will download county-level data for
        the entire US.

    Returns
    -------
        A :py:class:`~pd.DataFrame` or `~gpd.GeoDataFrame` containing the requested US Census data.

            values that the U.S. Census API sometimes returns. If `True`, then all
            values in :py:ref:`censusdis.values.ALL_SPECIAL_VALUES` will be replaced.
            If `False`, no replacements will be made.
        skip_annotations
            If `True` try to filter out `group` or `leaves_of_group` variables that are
            annotations rather than actual values. See :py:meth:`VariableCache.group_variables`
            for more details. Variable names passed in `download_variables` are not
            affected by this flag.
        with_geometry
            If `True` a :py:class:`gpd.GeoDataFrame` will be returned and each row
            will have a geometry that is a cartographic boundary suitable for platting
            a map. See https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.2020.html
            for details of the shapefiles that will be downloaded on your behalf to
            generate these boundaries.
        remove_water
            If `True` and if with_geometry=True, will query TIGER for AREAWATER shapefiles and
            remove water areas from returned geometry.
        api_key
            An optional API key. If you don't have or don't use a key, the number
            of calls you can make will be limited to 500 per day.
        variable_cache
            A cache of metadata about variables.
        row_keys
            An optional set of identifier keys to help merge together requests for more than the census API limit of
            50 variables per query. These keys are useful for census datasets such as the Current Population Survey
            where the geographic identifiers do not uniquely identify each row.
        kwargs
            A specification of the geometry that we want data for. For example,
            `state = "*", county = "*"` will download county-level data for
            the entire US.

        Returns
        -------
            A :py:class:`~pd.DataFrame` or `~gpd.GeoDataFrame` containing the requested US Census data.
