        A dataframe of variables with one or more columns that

    Download data from the US Census API.

    This is the main API for downloading US Census data with the
    `censusdis` package. There are many examples of how to use
    this in the demo notebooks provided with the package at
    https://github.com/vengroff/censusdis/tree/main/notebooks.

    *A note on variables and groups*: there are multiple ways to specify the
    variables you want to download, either individually in `download_variables`,
    by one or more groups in `group`, and by the leaves of one or more groups
    in `leaves_of_group`. Note that these three sources af variables are
    deduplicated, so you will only get one column for a variable no matter
    how many times it is specified.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset
        The dataset to download from. For example `"acs/acs5"`,
        `"dec/pl"`, or `"timeseries/poverty/saipe/schdist"`.
    vintage
        The vintage to download data for. For most data sets this is
        an integer year, for example, `2020`. But for
        a timeseries data set, pass the string `'timeseries'`.
    download_variables
        The census variables to download, for example `["NAME", "B01001_001E"]`.
    group
        One or more groups (as defined by the U.S. Census for the data set)
        whose variable values should be downloaded. These are in addition to
        any specified in `download_variables`.
    leaves_of_group
        One or more groups (as defined by the U.S. Census for the data set)
        whose leaf variable values should be downloaded.These are in addition to
        any specified in `download_variables` or `group`. See
        :py:meth:`VariableCache.group_leaves` for more details on the semantics of
        leaves vs. non-leaf group variables.
    set_to_nan
        If not `None`, this specifies special values that should be replaced with
        `NaN`. Normally :py:ref:`censusdis.values.ALL_SPECIAL_VALUES` or a subset thereof.
        The default is `None` so that we never change values without the caller
        explicitly asking us to. Setting to `True` is equivalent to
        :py:ref:`censusdis.values.ALL_SPECIAL_VALUES`.
    skip_annotations
        If `True` try to filter out `group` or `leaves_of_group` variables that are
        annotations rather than actual values. See :py:meth:`VariableCache.group_variables`
        for more details. Variable names passed in `download_variables` are not
        affected by this flag.
    with_geometry
        If `True` a :py:class:`gpd.GeoDataFrame` will be returned and each row
        will have a geometry that is a cartographic boundary suitable for platting
        a map. See https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.2020.html
        for details of the shapefiles that will be downloaded on your behalf to
        generate these boundaries.
    api_key
        An optional API key. If you don't have or don't use a key, the number
        of calls you can make will be limited.
    variable_cache
        A cache of metadata about variables.
    kwargs
        A specification of the geometry that we want data for.

    Returns
    -------
        A :py:class:`~pd.DataFrame` containing the requested US Census data.
