Helper map for the _with_geometry case.

A map from the innermost level of a geometry specification
to the arguments we need to pass to `get_cb_shapefile`
to get the right shapefile for the geography and the columns
we need to join the data and shapefile on.

The values are functions of the year. Once we locate one, we
call it with the year as an argument to get the final value.
This is necessary for e.g. congressional districts, which have
names that change every two years. It also turns out to be very
helpful in dealing with little quirks in the data like changing
the name of the COUSUB/COSUBFP column in just one year.

We should add everything in
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html
to this map.

    Infer the geography level based on columns names.

    Parameters
    ----------
    year
        The vintage of the data. `None` to infer from the data.
    df_data
        A dataframe of variables with one or more columns that
        can be used to infer what geometry level the rows represent.

        For example, if the column `"STATE"` exists, we could infer that
        the data in on a state by state basis. But if there are
        columns for both `"STATE"` and `"COUNTY"`, the data is probably
        at the county level.

        If, on the other hand, there is a `"COUNTY" column but not a
        `"STATE"` column, then there is some ambiguity. The data
        probably corresponds to counties, but the same county ID can
        exist in multiple states, so we will raise a
        :py:class:`~CensusApiException` with an error message expalining
        the situation.

        If there is no match, we will also raise an exception. Again we
        do this, rather than for example, returning `None`, so that we
        can provide an informative error message about the likely cause
        and what to do about it.

        This function is not often called directly, but rather from
        :py:func:`~add_inferred_geography`, which infers the geography
        level and then adds a `geometry` column containing the appropriate
