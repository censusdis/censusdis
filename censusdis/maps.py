        This method reads maps suitable
        for use with geometric joins and queries of various types. If you are
        only interested in plotting maps, the
        :py:meth:`~ShapeReader.read_cb_shapefile` method may be more suitable.

        The files are read from the US Census servers and cached locally.
        They are in most cases the same files you can download manually from

        Individual files the API may download follow a naming convention

        for New Jersey would be found at

        This method knows many of the subtle changes that have occurred over the years,

        otherwise.

        Once read, the files are cached locally so that when we reuse the same

        Parameters
        ----------
        state
             The state, e.g. `STATE_NJ`.
        geography
            The geography we want to download bounds for. Supported
            geometries are `"state'`, `"county"`, `"cousub"` (county subdivision),
            `"tract"`, and `"bg"` (block group). Other geometries as defined
            by the US Census may work, but have not been thoroughly tested.
        crs
            The crs to make the file to. If `None`, use the default
            crs of the shapefile. Setting this is useful if we plan
            to merge the resulting `GeoDataFrame` with another so we
            can make sure they use the same crs.

            `"tract"`, and `"bg"` (block group)
        resolution
            What resolution shapes should we use. Permitted options are

            1:20,000,000 resolution respectively. Availability varies, but for
