        Read the geometries of geographies.

        This method reads maps suitable
        for use with geometric joins and queries of various types. If you are
        only interested in plotting maps, the
        :py:meth:`~ShapeReader.read_cb_shapefile` method may be more suitable.

        for New Jersey would be found at

        https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2020/BG/tl_2020_34_bg.zip.

        This method knows many of the subtle changes that have occurred over the years,

        them all, so please submit an
        issue at https://github.com/vengroff/censusdis/issues if you find
        otherwise.

        Once read, the files are cached locally so that when we reuse the same
        files we do not have to go back to the server.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shapefile_scope
            The geography that is covered by the entire shapefile. In some
            cases, this is a state, e.g. `NJ`. For cases where files
            are available for the entire country, the string `"us"` is typically
            used. In some rare cases, like for the Alaska Native Regional Corporations
            (``"anrc"``) geography, other strings like ``"02"`` are used.

        geography
            The geography we want to download bounds for. Supported
            geometries are `"state'`, `"county"`, `"cousub"` (county subdivision),
            `"tract"`, and `"bg"` (block group). Other geometries as defined
            by the US Census may work, but have not been thoroughly tested.
        crs
            The crs to make the file to. If `None`, use the default
            crs of the shapefile. Setting this is useful if we plan
            to merge the resulting `GeoDataFrame` with another so we
            can make sure they use the same crs.
        timeout
            Time out limit (in seconds) for the remote call.

        Returns
        -------
