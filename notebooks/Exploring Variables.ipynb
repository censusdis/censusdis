    "# Exploring a Group of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are thousands of different variables avaialble via the US Census\n",
    "API. One way to navigate through them is to look through a hierarchy\n",
    "of web pages starting with a year, like 2020, on a page like \n",
    "https://api.census.gov/data/2020.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "From here we can navigate down\n",
    "to a particular data source, by following the link \n",
    "in the *Group List* column of the first row, which is for the dataset\n",
    "`acs/acs5`. This takes us to \n",
    "https://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/acs5/groups.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there,\n",
    "we can choose the group named B03002, which takes us to \n",
    "https://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/acs5/groups/B03002.html, where we \n",
    "can see all the variables in the group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these variables are estimates,\n",
    "and some of them are annotations. Normally, we are interested in the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every variable has a label, which is a string of components seperated by\n",
    "!!. For example, B03002_007E has the label, \n",
    "\"Estimate!!Total:!!Not Hispanic or Latino:!!Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone\".\n",
    "The !! seperators imply a tree among the variables, from the root all the way down\n",
    "to leaves. Internal nodes in the tree represent variables that are aggregates of \n",
    "those lower than them in the tree. For example, B03002_002E is the size of the \n",
    "population that is not Hispanic or Latino, regardless of race. It is the sum of\n",
    "B03002_003E, B03002_004E, B03002_005E, B03002_006E, B03002_007E, B03002_008E, and B03002_009E,\n",
    "which count people of different races who are not Hispanic or Latino. All of these\n",
    "are leaves of the tree, except B03002_009E, which is further subdivided into\n",
    "B03002_010E and B03002_011E.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this can get really confusing when you look at it in the tabular form\n",
    "on the web page. In order to make it less confusing, the `censusdis` package\n",
    "includes code to fetch and present the variable hierarchy in a more understandable\n",
    "way. That's what the remainder of this notebook is about."
